# Contributing to JInsta

Thanks for your interest in JInsta. Our goal is to bring automated Instagram interactions to all JVM-based communities.

## Getting Started

JInsta's [open issues are here](https://github.com/Makepad-fr/jinsta/issues). In time, we'll tag issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors. An easy way to get started helping the project is to [file an issue](https://github.com/Makepad-fr/jinsta/issues/new). You can do that on the Deeplearning4j issues page by clicking on the green button at the right. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated.

## Contributions

JInsta welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to JInsta should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the `development` branch and, if needed, rebase to the current `development`
branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
`development` you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, for commits messages we are following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.

## Conduct

All interactions in our official communication channels follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All code in this repository is under the Apache Software Foundation License, 2.0.
